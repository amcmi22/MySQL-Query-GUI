This is a project that was completed in EECS 3421, Introduction to Database Management Systems. I was given starter code with the tasks of integrating a MySQL database into the application, and translating the user's selection into a working MySQL query.
I wrote all the code that connects the database and the logic behind making the user's queries run.
- Transformed user input from a GUI to a working MySQL query by analyzing input and
constructing valid syntax
- Ran the userâ€™s query through a whitelist to prevent SQL Injection and malicious code from
corrupting the database
- Added error blocking and messages to the user when they entered incorrect input to increase
usability of the application and ease of access to the user
