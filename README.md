This is a project that was completed in EECS 3421, Introduction to Database Management Systems. I was given starter code with the tasks of integrating a MySQL database into the application, and translating the user's selection into a working MySQL query.
I wrote all the code that connects the database and the logic behind making the user's queries run.
